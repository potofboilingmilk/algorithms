RECURSION LAYER: 	0 
Parent 	= 		30
Left	=		18
Right	=		44
Left is not NULL; recur to the left node.

RECURSION LAYER:	1
Parent 	=		18
Left	=		11
Right	=		21
Left is not NULL; recur to the left node.

RECURSION LAYER:	2
Parent	=		11
Left	=		NULL
Right	=		NULL
Left is NULL; recur to the left, but immediately break out of that recursion layer (returning to this one).
Proceed function execution: output Parent's value.
Printed values: 11
Right is NULL; recur to the right, but immediately break out of that recursion layer (returning to this one).
Conclude function execution; break out of this recursion layer.

RECURSION LAYER:	1
Parent 	=		18
Left	=		11
Right	=		21
Proceed function execution: output Parent's value.
Printed values: 11 18
We cannot attempt to recur left after printing the value of Parent.
Right is not NULL; recur to the right.

RECURSION LAYER:	2
Parent	=		21
Left	=		NULL
Right	=		NULL
Left is NULL; recur to the left, but immediately break out of that recursion layer (returning to this one).
Proceed function execution: output Parent's value.
Printed values: 11 18 21
Right is NULL; recur to the right, but immediately break out of that recursion layer (returning to this one).
Conclude function execution; break out of this recursion layer.

RECURSION LAYER: 	1
Parent 	=		18
Left	=		11
Right	=		21
Conclude function execution; break out of this recursion layer.

RECURSION LAYER: 	0 
Parent 	= 		30
Left	=		18
Right	=		44
Proceed function execution: output Parent's value.
Printed values: 11 18 21 30
Right is not NULL; recur to the right.

RECURSION LAYER:	1
Parent	=		44
Left 	=		35
Right	=		50
Left is not NULL; recur to the left.

RECURSION LAYER:	2
Parent	=		35
Left 	=		NULL
Right	=		NULL
Left is NULL; recur to the left, but immediately break out of that recursion layer (returning to this one).
Proceed function execution: output Parent's value.
Printed values: 11 18 21 35
Right is NULL; recur to the right, but immediately break out of that recursion layer (returning to this one).
Conclude function execution; break out of this recursion layer.

RECURSION LAYER:	1

Right is not NULL; recur to the right.

RECURSION LAYER:	2
Parent  = 		50
Left	=		NULL
Right	=		NULL
Left is NULL; recur to the left, but immediately break out of that recursion layer (returning to this one).
Proceed function execution: output Parent's value.
Printed values: 11 18 21 35 44 50
Right is NULL; recur to the right, but immediately break out of that recursion layer (returning to this one).
Conclude function execution; break out of this recursion layer.

RECURSION LAYER:	1

Conclude function execution; break out of this recursion layer.

RECURSION LAYER: 	0 
Parent 	= 		30
Left	=		18
Right	=		44
Conclude function execution; no more recursion layers exist; execution fully concluded.
Final printed values: 11 18 21 35 44 50
